# Code Explanation

This code snippet demonstrates various operations in Dart programming language.

## Operations Performed

1. **Division (`/`):** Divides `x` by `z` and stores the result in `a`.
2. **Modulus (`%`):** Computes the remainder of `x` divided by `z` and stores it in `b`.
3. **Less Than (`<`) Operator:** Checks if `x` is less than `z` and stores the result in `c`.
4. **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`) Operator:** Checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `z` and stores the result in `d`.
5. **Type Check (`is`):** Checks if `y` is of type `double` and stores the result in `e`.
6. **Type Check Negation (`is!`):** Checks if `y` is not of type `double` and stores the result in `f`.
7. **Postfix Increment (`++`):** Increments the value of `y` after its current value has been used in the expression and stores the original value in `g`.
8. **Postfix Decrement (`--`):** Decrements the value of `x` after its current value has been used in the expression and stores the original value in `h`.

## Output

The code prints the results of these operations along with relevant variable values.

## Running the Code

To run this code, ensure you have Dart installed on your system. Then, copy the code into a Dart file (e.g., `main.dart`) and execute it using the Dart VM or an IDE with Dart support.

```bash
dart Operation.dart
